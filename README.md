## Overview

Vision System for part dimensional measurement and dataset comparison.


This project is focused on developing a machine vision system for inspection with added dynamic extraction of corresponding part data from dataset.

In this project dataset is basically a file which stores all the dimensional data of different parts/objects.This also stores the different views(front view,side view and top view)of each part/object.




## Introduction

-> Vision system is the extraction of information using camera and transforming these data into digital form which is further processed. 

-> These data is processed, manipulated and implemented in processes like inspection, identification, measurement, detection, location and many more.




## Process flow and Objective

-> Design and Development of a vision system for inspection and part identification.

-> Automatic scanning of all 4 sides of the machined part using the camera and a rotating base.

-> Extract digital images and process this digital data (image processing).

->Compare these data with the pre-feed 2D draft of part from dataset.

-> Dataset stores all the part data .The system fetch corresponding part data dynamically from database.

-> The system provides part dimensions , 2D drawing of part , Comparison with master image , Feature matching with master image , Generation of report.

-> The system will produce results like verified, unidentified, or rework according to its comparison results.

-> Display of results and generation of the report.
